# Final Project

Matthew Rice, mhrice@ucsd.edu

## Abstract Proposal

For my final project, I will revist the music generation assignment. I would like to create a real-time version of this project, in that I play piano or bassline "licks", and the model will generate drum tracks to "accompany" my licks. Then I will have a separate model generate new licks and then the original model generate new drum tracks to the new rif, creating an AI jam session. This model expands on the idea of using a VAE to generate music by allowing two such instances of these models to generate music for themselves. I will present this work by bringing my audio equipment to class and starting the "jam session" with a couple licks and then allowing the networks to generate new music. 


## Project Report

Upload your project report (4 pages) as a pdf with your repository, following this template: [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133H59WZBmH6MlAgFSskFLMQITeIC5d9b2iuzsOfa4E8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- What you include here will very much depend on the format of your final project
  - image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
  - 3d models
  - movie files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
  - audio files
  - ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
- Repositories
- Blog posts


(This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept and approach. What are your desired creative goals? How are you expanding on something we covered in the class? How will you present your work next Wednesday in the final project presentations? )
